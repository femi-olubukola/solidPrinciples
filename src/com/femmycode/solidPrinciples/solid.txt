SOLID PRINCIPLES


➡︎ Single Responsibility
    Each class should have a single responsibility;
    each class should have only one sole purpose.


➡︎ Open Closed
    Classes should be open for extension,
    closed for modification. An existing class shouldn't
    be re-written to implement new features.


➡︎ Liskov Substitution
    Each class should have a single responsibility;
    each class should have only one sole purpose.

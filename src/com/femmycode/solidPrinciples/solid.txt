SOLID PRINCIPLES of OOP


➡︎ Single Responsibility
    Each class should have a single responsibility;
    each class should have only one sole purpose.


➡︎ Open Closed
    Classes should be open for extension,
    closed for modification. An existing class shouldn't
    be re-written to implement new features.


➡︎ Liskov Substitution
    Every subclass(derived class) should be substitutable for their
    parent class(base class).


➡︎ Interface Segregation
    Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.
    Interfaces shouldn't force classes to implement what they
    can't do.


➡︎ Dependency Inversion
    Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
    Our classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes.
